  <H1>The Grading Problem</H1>
  HackerLand University has the following grading policy:<br/>
- Every student receives an initial grade in the inclusive range of whole
numbers from 0 to 100.<br/>
- A modification is made to the initial grade before it becomes a final grade.
  <br/>
- Any final grade less than 40 is a failing grade.<br/>

  <br/>
Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's initial
grade according to these rules:<br/>

- If the difference between the initial grade and the next multiple of 5 is
less than 3, round the grade up to the next multiple of 5.<br/>
- If the value of the initial grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the
result will still be a failing grade.<br/>
  <p>Input: <span id="input"></span></p>
  <p>Answer: <span id="answer"></span></p>  <!-- 75, 67, 40, 33 -->
